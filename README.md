## Serialization and deserialization in .NET

Serialization is the process of converting the state of an object into a form that can be persisted or transported. The complement of serialization is deserialization, which converts a stream into an object. Together, these processes allow data to be stored and transferred.

In This project I will  create a CSV file in C# from a list or collection using the open source CsvHelper .NET Standard library and read from external CSV. 

## Extensions
- C#
- C# Dev Kit
  

## Installation 
Create .Net core console app
```
dotnet new console
```

install the CSV helper library using this command:
For Visual Studio Code users:

```
dotnet add package CsvHelper
```
For Visual Studio users, use package manager console command:
```
Install-package Csvhelper
```
